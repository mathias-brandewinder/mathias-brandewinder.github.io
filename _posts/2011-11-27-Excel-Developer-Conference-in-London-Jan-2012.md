Earlier this month, on [Simon Murphy’s blog](http://smurfonspreadsheets.wordpress.com/), the project to organize a UK Excel Developer conference 2012 in London [quickly](http://smurfonspreadsheets.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/reader-request/) [took](http://smurfonspreadsheets.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/excel-developer-conference-london-jan-2012/) [shape](http://smurfonspreadsheets.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/excel-developer-conference-update/). As of now, the planned date is in the **January 24 to 26** range, with a pretty cool [**agenda**](http://xlconf.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/uk-excel-developer-conference-london-january-2012/), covering most of the recent developments Excel developers should know about. I am looking forward to it!  

I’ll be talking for about an hour on VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office). VSTO can be both awesome and painful: I plan on demoing building an Excel add-in from the ground up, illustrating some of the benefits and drawbacks/pitfalls of that approach, so that you know when it’s the right time to go that route.  

If there are any topics or questions you are specifically interested in, please let me know in the comments – I’ll be happy to take requests.  

As an aside, I usually talk at .NET developers events, where I need to convince the audience that developing for Excel (or Office) isn’t a terrible idea. This will be my first time with an Excel developers audience, and I expect the opposite challenge, namely why bother with C#/VB.NET and Visual Studio when VBA is free and works just fine?  

Check out the [Excel Conference](http://xlconf.wordpress.com/) page and [Simon’s blog](http://smurfonspreadsheets.wordpress.com/) for updates.
