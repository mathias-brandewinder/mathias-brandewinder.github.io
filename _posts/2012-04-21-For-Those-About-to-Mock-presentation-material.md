I presented “For Those About to Mock”, an introduction to Mocking for C# developers, at the [San Francisco chapter of Bay .NET](http://www.meetup.com/BayNET/events/60218172/) last week, and promised I would make the material available.  

Here it is: you can [**download the code “For Those About to Mock” here**]({{ site.url }}/downloads/ForThoseAboutToMock.zip).

Thanks for everyone who made it, it was a great crowd with lots of good questions – I had a great time!
