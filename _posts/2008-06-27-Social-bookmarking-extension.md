Just added the [blogengine.net social bookmarking extension](http://dannydouglass.com/post/2008/01/Add-Social-Bookmarking-Links-To-Your-Blog.aspx) written by Danny Douglas. Pretty smooth installation, and the icons do look nice, I like it so far. On the downside, I was hoping to find a "real" ShareThis (or equivalent) BlogEngine.Net extension. With the proliferation of various social bookmarking sites, blogs tend to get the Nascar look, with gazillions of buttons, widgets and whatnot - and ShareThis resolves that problem neatly, by replacing all these in [one single button](http://www.elifbatuman.net/), which doesn't clutter your blog. Ah well, I guess if I want it hard enough, I should just go and write it!
