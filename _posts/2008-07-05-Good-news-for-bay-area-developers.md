First piece of good news this week, the website for [Silicon Valley CodeCamp 08 is up](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/) (and beautiful!), and registrations are open. If you haven't been at CodeCamp yet, you should definitely check it out: it's free, it's by developers, for developers, and it's fun. It's a great place to go to meet fellow developers and learn; and if you are itching to try out your presentation skills and are passionate about a topic, it's a great place to get your feet wet with a friendly crowd! I plan on giving two talks this year, one on [Test-Driven Development](http://codecamp.pbwiki.com/TestDrivenDevelopmentanintroforCdevelopers2008), and one on [VSTO development](http://codecamp.pbwiki.com/OfficedevelopmentWhowouldwanttodothat2008).


Second piece of good news, after a bit of a hibernation period, the Silicon Valley / South Bay chapter of Bay.Net is resurfacing! Stay tuned on the [Bay.Net website](http://www.baynetug.org/) for updates - but as of now, the first session is expected to take place end July, with Scott Stanfield of Vertigo talking about DeepZoom, a spectacular illustration of what can be done with Silverlight.
