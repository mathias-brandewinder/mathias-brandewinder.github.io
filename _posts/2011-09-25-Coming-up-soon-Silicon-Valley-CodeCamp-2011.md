It’s this time of the year again: on Saturday & Sunday October 8 + 9, [Silicon Valley CodeCamp](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/) is taking place at Foothill College in Los Altos Hill. There are currently over 200 sessions listed, and 2000 people signed up already. I am expecting lots of fun - again.  

I’ll be giving [3 talks this year](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?AttendeeId=583)      

* Sat, 11:45: **Beginning TDD for C# Developers**.    
* Sun, 1:15: **For Those About to Mock**.     
* Sun, 2:45: **An excursion in F#**   
 
Hope to see you there, and also that I will have some energy left to attend some of the other talks!
