Last week, we had our [first Coding Dojo at SFSharp.org](http://www.meetup.com/sfsharp/events/115207492/), the San Francisco F# group – and it was great! A few people in the group had mentioned that at that point they were already convinced F# was a great language, and that what they wanted was help getting started writing actual code, so I figured this would be a good format to try out. 

What I wanted was something fun, something cool people could realistically achieve under 2 hours. I settled for one of the [Kaggle introduction problems](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), a classic of Machine Learning, where the goal is to automatically recognize hand-written digits. I didn’t think it would be fair to just throw people in the shark tank without any guidance, especially for F# beginners, so I prepared a minimal slide deck to explain the problem and data set, and a “guided script”, with hints and language syntax examples. 

And… it worked! The attendees were absolutely awesome. We had people from [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/), [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/), and two people who drove [all the way from Sacramento](https://twitter.com/zychr); we had beginners and experienced FSharpers – and everybody managed to get a classifier working, from scratch. Having some beers available definitely helped, too.

My favorite part is this one attendee, a F# beginner, who kept going at it after the meeting was over, and [posted an algorithm improvement in the comments](http://www.meetup.com/sfsharp/events/115207492/) section of the Meetup a couple days after. Way to go! And given the positive response, we’ll definitely have more of these. 

Also wanted to say a huge thanks to [Matt Harrington](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/matt-harrington/), first for starting this user group back then, and then for still being an incredible supporter of the F# community in SF, in spite of a crazy work schedule. Thanks, Matt!
